"The classes below seem to implement an API interface. It is recommended to inject the interface instead of the class to prevent preferences to be ignored and respect the coding standards.","以下類似乎實現了 API 介面。建議注入介面而不是類，以防止偏好設置被忽略並遵守代碼編寫標準。"
"Specific Class Injection","特定類注入"
"A class should not be injected in constructor as a specific class. In most of the cases, a factory, a builder or an interface should be used. This automatic scan can not be 100% accurate, please verify manually.","類不應作為特定類注入到構造函數中。在大多數情況下，應使用工廠、構建器或介面。此自動掃描無法 100% 準確，請手動驗證。"
